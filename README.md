This is my version of the final task (module 4.3) from [Stepik course](https://stepik.org/course/575/info "Автоматизация тестирования с помощью Selenium и Python") dedicated to learning Selenium using Python. 
I want you to notice that there is a list of requirements to my project that you have to install before executing it.
List includes not only Pytest and Selenium itself but essential components for the proper execution of the project.
